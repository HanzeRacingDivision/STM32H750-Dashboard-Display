This is the relevant code for the Dashboard Display of the HRD06.
TouchGFX and STM32CubeIDE don't work well with GitHub, so this is just a way of keeping progress.

Only the files that are manually changed are updated in this repository. 
The rest are self generated or updated by the software itself, 
so there is no way of keeping track of all the progress.

It is not very clear as a stand-alone repository, so email me for any questions.
